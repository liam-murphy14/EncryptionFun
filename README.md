# EncryptionFun
This program is a fun encoding CLI program. After choosing whether to encode or decode a message, the user is prompted to enter a message, either in the encoding scheme or in plaintext. If the _encode_ option is chosen, then the user is prompted to input the phone number of someone that they would like to send the message to. The script then automatically sends the encoded message. Only works on Mac.
